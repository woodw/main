	<h3>I... finished?</h3>
	<p>Today I finally made it a priority to complete the indie game Lone Survivor. The game is not a lengthy one so my advise to anyone looking to pick it up... play it all at once. I spent to much time inbetween each play session and here I sit confused of what it was all for; Which fans of the game can argue was probably the point... sure.</p>

	<h3>Design Hiatus</h3>
	<p>In the future blueSquare will be a place that I can show off my design idea. This thought has carried me though so many differant iterations of the site. But the thing that was really holding me back was the fact that I had never started to actually talk about any of my ideas. I was running with the idea that my first work for the website would be a "freebie" while the rest would have fantastic documentation. I believe I'm starting to see that without blogging while working, I'm stunting my ability to grow and review during the process. So for now things at silly simple and we use this as a base.</p>
